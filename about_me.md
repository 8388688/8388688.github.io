8388688, 在 2020 年 1 月开始投身于编程, 至今已两年有余, 但仍然是个小白. 
你说他喜欢这一行, 也确实, 他没事时就常常编一些现在看来很无聊但当时自觉有趣的小程序. 
你说他不喜欢这一行, 也说得过去, 他对于一些高深复杂的代码宁可放弃也不愿去往深里钻研.~~(摆烂状态)~~

8388688 has been in program since Jan.2020. But it's still a beginner.
If you said that he liked it, and it was true that when he was free, he used to compile some little programs that seemed dull but at the time he felt interesting.
If you said that he doesn't like it, and it was also ture that he would rather give up some difficult code than explore deeper.~~(giving up)~~
